Overall objective of the project is to create a simple chat application providing communication between two users.
My main takeaways are that this app could be useful to anyone trying to talk to each other in a quick and easy manner.
Features will include a login/register page controlled by segmented control, an option to upload a profile image, and a chat log for users to refer back to.
This app will be different from competitors by not adding a ton of elements in the user interface. My goal was to make this easier to navigate through than others.
There is a deadline for this app so constraints will be applied.
This was an app instead of a website because people like to be able to communicate with each other without having to bring their whole desktop with them everywhere they go.
