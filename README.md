My Chat Application is an app that allows users to chat with each other similarly to the default apple texting application.
Users can either sign in or register upon opening the app, and then upload a user profile picture and get logged in.  After being logged in, a user can message a contact in their address book by composing a new text. This is the overall functionality of this application.
