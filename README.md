My Chat Application is an app that allows users to chat with each other similarly to the default apple texting application.
Users can either sign in or register upon opening the app, and then upload a user profile picture and get logged in.  After being logged in, a user can message a contact in their address book by composing a new text. This is the overall functionality of this application. This app uses Firebase as its back end data base to store users images and messages. In terms of design i decided to create this app programmatically. I chose to use segmented control for the user login page, and then just went with a simple, easy to use design. There were some hurdles I had to overcome in terms of errors but it wasnt anything that I couldnt overcome.
