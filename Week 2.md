My chat app allows users to communicate back and forth with each other in a quick and simple way. The user interface is clean
and well thought out, and easy to navigate. Once a user logs in or registers, they will be taken to the home screen where they will have the choice to click on a previous conversation, or compose a new message with someone by clicking the button in the right hand corner. Once clicking this button the user will be taken to the list of contacts they can start a new conversation with. Some of the technologies used include Firebase as my back end database, as well as programmatic UI.
